<!--
  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, so this language (not programming language) is based on *tags* and *attributes*
-->
<!--
  A tag is just a keyword surrounded by the <> symbols. A closing tag is just a tag with a / symbol before the keyword.
-->
<!--
  In most cases, web content is surrounded with a tag and a closing tag and that is how an element is defined
-->
<!--
  There are also a few *self-closing tags*, which are tags that have no content wrapped so there is no need of an opening and closing
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  This must be always the first tag in a HTML document and does not make any change to de loaded page, but is a convention to make the browser recognize all the next lines as HTML code
-->
<html>
  <!--
    This tag wraps all the content of the page. It commonly have two children: <head> and <body>
  -->
  <head>
    <!--
      The <head> tag contains important elements that contributes to the page but are not visible in the browser, like meta information and the page title
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--
      This is one of many meta info a web page can have. This particularly is very important because is telling the browser what character set (charset) to use in order to recognize all the characters like accent marks
    -->
    <title>HTML basics</title>
    <!--
      The <title> tag defines the page title that can be seen in the browser tab
    -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
      The <body> tag wraps all the visible content of a page, all the text and images that the user can see
    -->
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <!--
      This tag defines a heading in the page. There are six types of headings from <h1> to <h6> in order of relevance and visually are decreasing in size.
    -->
    <p>
      Our world, planet Earth, has been translating around the Sun for over 4.5
      billion years ago. The surface of this blue planet is about 3/4 covered
      with water and the rest is land in larger or smaller extensions such as
      continents or little islands.
    </p>
    <!-- the <p> tag stands for paragraph and it is used for common text -->
    <h2>Hello Venus!</h2>
    <p>
      Venus is the closest planet to the Earth and that's why often it can be
      seen by the human naked eye.
    </p>

    <h3>Hello Mars!</h3>
    <p>
      This planet is the favorite of sci-fi writers as we can see martians in
      many fiction movies and books. It has a particular red color and it is the
      actual focus of a potential planet migration in the future.
    </p>

    <h4>Hello Mercury!</h4>
    <p>
      The smallest planet of the Solar System. Also it is the closest planet to
      the Sun and, therefore, the hottest.
    </p>

    <h5>Hello Moon!</h5>
    <p>
      It's the only Earth's natural satellite. It takes 28 days to orbit the
      planet and it can be seen generally at night
    </p>

    <h6>Hello Pluto!</h6>
    <p>
      Pluto was considered the ninth planet of the Solar System until the formal
      definition of "planet" in 2006. Now it is considered a
      <span>dwarf planet</span>
    </p>
    <br />
    <!-- This is a line break, i.e. leaves a space between elements -->
    <p>Here is a list of planets in the Solar System, followed by an ilustrative image:</p>
    <ol>
      <!--
        this is a list. It can be defined as an ordered list <ol> with numbered elements or unordered list <ul> with bulleted elements. The list elements are always wrapped by the <ol> or <ul> and are defined by the <li> tag (whether is an ordered or unordered list) and the content is written within
      -->
      <li>Mercury</li>
      <li>Venus</li>
      <li>Earth</li>
      <li>Mars</li>
      <li>Jupiter</li>
      <li>Saturn</li>
      <li>Uranus</li>
      <li>Neptune</li>

    />
    <!--
      The <img/> tag is used for the images. It is a self-closing tag so doesn't need to be closed, only with a / after the keyword. It also need an attribute, in this case "src" that specifies where the image is located. src attribute may receive either absolute or relative paths
    -->
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <table>
      <!--
        The <table> tag defines the structure of a table. It generally has two children: <thead> and <tbody>
      -->
      <thead>
        <!--
          The head of the body can be used to indicate titles and names of the columns
        -->
        <tr>
          <!--
            <tr> represents a table row and it must be used every time a row is added to the table to wrap all the content of the row
          -->
          <th colspan="4">Technical information</th>
          <!--
            <th> is a cell of the table and there it must be written the number of the column. all table cells can have the colspan attribute that tells the <th> to take n number of columns. A table title can be easily made by setting colspan value to the total of columns

      Fun fact: the planets of the Solar System were named like roman gods. Here
      is again the list with the corresponding god of each planet:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mercury: God of messengers, travel, and/or commerce.</li>
      <li>Venus: Goddess of romance and lust.</li>
      <li>Mars: God of War.</li>
      <li>Earth (Terra): Godess of the earth</li>
      <li>Jupiter: God of the sky and lightning.</li>
      <li>Saturn: God of Agriculture.</li>
      <li>Uranus (Caelus): Primordial god of the Sky.</li>
      <li>Neptune: God of the Sea.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>

  There are two other basic tags, <div> and <span>, that will be covered in CSS basics
